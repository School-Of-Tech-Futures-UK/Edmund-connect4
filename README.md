# Connect4 by Edmund


Connect4 is a two-player board game that allows each player to drop a coloured disc (red or yellow) from the top into a column, which occupies the lowest available space within the column. A player wins the game by being the first one to achieve placing four discs in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonally). 

# Rules & Layout

# Skills applied from SoTF Training

This game is built with the lessons and skills acquired throughout the first five weeks of SoTF training.

# Week 1 - JavaScript Basics
- Conditional statements (if, else if) are used to perform actions like taking turns and declaring winner based on set conditions
- Arrays are used to map out a grid for the game board and provide placement logic for the discs
- For Loops are used to navigate the defined grid and check for winning combinations  

# Week 2 - HTML, CSS, HOF
- The visual content of the game is structured using HTML and styled using CSS
- HOF are used in unit testing for javascript functions

# Week 3 - Asynch, API calls
- Async functions used to get and post high scores between client and server while adhering to REST

# Week 4 - Unit Testing
- Impure functions are re-written to become pure before executing unit tests on them using Jest

# Week 5 - React
- Did not apply any React skills in this connect4 game
